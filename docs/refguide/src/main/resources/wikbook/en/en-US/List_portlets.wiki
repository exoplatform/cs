{docbook}

The Chatbar portlet shows the Chatbar application of eXo Collaboration that can be positioned in the portal or page layout as any other, but behaves as a floating box. The bar remains floating at its location even when the browser window is scrolled or resized. Its height is fixed, but can be expanded horizontally to any size available in its container. This allows the portlet to be placed in two layout cases:

- Large width area (typically header or footer).

- Narrow column.

The Chatbar application implements all functions of the Chat application, allowing you to send and receive messages anywhere after you are logged in successfully. The Chatbar is a typical toolbar with buttons to open menus. It gives access to main features of Chat:

- Status change and presence indicator.

- Contacts.

- Rooms.

- Minimized conversation window.
